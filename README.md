# pong

Pong is a Python program I have created to recreate the old fashioned game of pong where two paddles which move vertically only, have to hit the ball to their opponent without missing it. This program uses the PyGame library for the GUI. 

## Modules to Install

To run the program you will need to install PyGame by running the following command:

pip install pygame
